The t3editor is based on the CodeMirror-project by Marijn Haverbeke (http://marijn.haverbeke.nl/codemirror/)

Currently the release 0.55 is used. 
To use the CodeMirror for the t3editor some changes were needed.  The file "patch.codemirror055.diff" contains a patch to apply the needed changes in the codemirror source.

See the LICENSE file for the CodeMirror license.
All files in this folder (typo3/sysext/t3editor/jslib/codemirror/) are part of the CodeMirror and therefore licened under the CodeMirror license.

t3editor itself is part of TYPO3 and therefore licened under GPL (as TYPO3 is).
